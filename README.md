Project done as a database that holds computer info
you can use the processes like this for example:
in your terminal, type: gcc -o ccadd ccadd.c
then: ./ccadd (inputs)
this would start up the database. Alternatively you can use the menu instead which is the preferred method but that is how you run any file in here.
